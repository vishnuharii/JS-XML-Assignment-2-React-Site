# Full-Stack Web Development Assignment 2 (React)

This project is part of my full-stack web development assignment where I created a React frontend that interacts with a backend API built using Express. The backend API was deployed using Render, and the frontend React app was deployed using Vercel.

## Project Links

- **Frontend URL** (React app): [https://js-xml-assignment-2-react-site-b9ia3tquq.vercel.app](https://js-xml-assignment-2-react-site-b9ia3tquq.vercel.app)
- **Backend API URL** (Express API): [https://assignment-1-full-stack-web-development-4.onrender.com](https://assignment-1-full-stack-web-development-4.onrender.com)

## Features

### Frontend (React):
- Built using React for a smooth, dynamic user experience.
- Fetches data from the backend API and displays it dynamically.
- Pages include a Home page, Product details, Login, Registration, and Cart.
- Provides functionality to interact with the API (e.g., viewing products, adding to cart).

### Backend (Express):
- REST API built with Express to handle requests from the React frontend.
- The API is deployed on Render.
- Routes for interacting with products, users, and cart data.
